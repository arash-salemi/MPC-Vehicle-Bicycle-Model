# MPC-Vehicle-Bicycle-Model
Linear and Non-Linear MPC controllers for path tracking of the vehicle bicycle model


- Excited the system with various signals and collected data to apply machine learning techniques to model the system dynamics (3DOF Vehicle Bicycle Model with Force Input in MATLAB)

- Linearized the model using the ARX function and developed a linear MPC controller with constraints
  
- Designed a nonlinear MPC controller with and without incorporating the NARX model and considering constraints to
perform trajectory tracking with minimum change in the vehicle yaw rate
